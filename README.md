# Othello_Game
 - Board Game developed by Nicholas Gliserman & Henry Hou as a group project for CSIS2410 at SLCC
 - Coded in Java using Javafx
 - n.b. To play, you will need the Javafx library (available https://openjfx.io/) and to configure the project to your local copy of the javafx library

# Game Objective
- Have the most tokens of your color on the board at the end of the game

# Rules
- 2 player game, played on a 8 x 8 board with white and black disks
- Board starts with alternating black and white disks in the center four squares
- Black plays first
- Current player places a disk in a space adjacent to a disk of the opposite color so that at least one row (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) is sandwiched by the current player's disks. 
- All opposite colors in such rows formed by this action are 'flipped' to match the current player.
- This concludes a turn and the next player goes.
- The game ends when neither player can make a move.
- At this point, the pieces on the board are tallied and the winner is declared.

# Future Work
- Build an AI agent so one person can play by themselves 
- Add UI elements explaining the rules
